# TOPDOGS

This site is targeted at dog lovers to view photos and brief profiles of other dogs from around the world. The site also offers the opportunity for users get involved and to submit their own dog to be published on the site for other users to admire. 

## Features

### Home page

* Navigation bar

    * Featured on all three pages, the full responsive bar includes Logo (links to homepage), home page, gallery and contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    * This section will allow the user to easily navigate between pages without having to revert back to the previous page via the browsers back button.
    * The navigation bar uses a collapsed 'hamburger' style for the link on mobile devices and smaller screen sizes. 

* Header top (home page main image)

    * The home page main image is a photograph made up of dogs so that users can immediatly visualise the context of the site.
    * The image has an overlay with text that describes the exact purpose of the site
    * the image is repeated horizontally so that on larger screens it gives the illusion of more dogs. 

* Header bottom

    * The header bottom provides details on how a user can get involved with the site with a button directing them to the contact page.
    * Another image of a dog provides further context of what the site is about.
    * The header bottom is responsive to screen size and will adjust accordingly.

* Footer

    * The footer section is repeated across all 3 pages for consistancy so the user can become comfortable with the layout no matter which page they are on.
    * The footer contains links to social media accounts that open in new windows so that they can easily go back to the page they were on.

## Testing

### Validator testing

* HTML

    * No eerros were returned when passing through the offical W3C validator

* CSS

    * No errors were found when passing through the offical (Jigsaw) validator

### Bugs

* font awesome was not loading images and giving an error of 'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404'. On further investigation i found that i was using the CSS link (<link href="/your-path-to-fontawesome/css/fontawesome.css" rel="stylesheet">) with a non existant pathway, rather then the hosted CDN link. I was able to correct this issue by taking out the incorrect CSS link and replaing it with the CDN link.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
